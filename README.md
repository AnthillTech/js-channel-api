# JavaScript client API 


This is JavaScript library which simplifies connection to the [Channel Server](https://github.com/AnthillTech/channel-server).

## Sample usage pattern

* connectToChannel
* sendMessageToChannel
* onChannelMessage
* disconnectFromChannel

This library will try to reconnect to the server if connection is closed.
